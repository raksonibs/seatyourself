want to select when created restaurant what days are avaialbel for that restuarant
	-need to change form of restuarant creation
	-need to associate models with date
restaurant.moments -> Monday: 80, Tueday: 80 when initialize as an owner 
and then when select date to reserve, from that day do we lose seats

need to add the restaurants sorted by categories! - restuarant has many catoegires and categories belong to res
order online! -need very simple menu
search for restaurant based on geographic location!

make nice. so first menu with items.
then rating system for each restuarant.
then online ordering
then geographic location near you #maybe not because did last time
then make look nice!

validate that time reservation has a cpacity, and the next hour si free (everoyne leaves at that time) restaurant.reservations.where(start_time: reservation.start_time).sum(:people)


@reservation
if restaurant.reservations.where(starttime: @reservation.starttime).sum(:users) + @reservation.numberofseats > @restaurant.totalsize
